Subject: Stop duplicate rendering across the PWA and eliminate the appended 404 card (keep real 404 only)

Context
- Every page appears twice (sections repeat). A 404 card sometimes shows at the bottom of valid pages.
- Goal: ensure the app mounts and renders exactly once, use a single router tree and a single catch‑all 404, and prevent dev/StrictMode or layout issues from duplicating UI.

Tasks (apply all)

1) Single mount point and single render
- index.html: ensure exactly one root node exists:
  <div id="root"></div>
  Remove any second root (e.g., <div id="app"> or modal root rendering the whole app).
- index.tsx:
  - Create the root once and render once:
    const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
    const app = <App />;
    root.render(import.meta.env.DEV ? <React.StrictMode>{app}</React.StrictMode> : app);
  - Search the codebase and remove any additional createRoot/ReactDOM.render calls that render App (or large shells) again.

2) One router provider only
- Ensure there is exactly one Router provider (e.g., BrowserRouter/RouterProvider) at the app top level.
- Remove any Router providers created inside pages, layouts, tab components, or admin shells.

3) One query/client/provider instance only
- Ensure there is only one instance each of global providers (e.g., QueryClientProvider, Theme, Redux, Toast/Modal providers). Do not re-wrap pages or layouts with these providers a second time.

4) Fix dev double-invocations and effect leaks
- StrictMode stays only in development (already handled above).
- Search for effects that append DOM/portals without cleanup (body.appendChild, creating toasts/modals, banners). Add proper cleanup in useEffect return and ensure these are mounted once at the top shell, not per page.

5) Prevent double service worker registration
- In the SW registration code, guard against multiple registrations:
  if ((window as any).__SW_REGISTERED__) return;
  (window as any).__SW_REGISTERED__ = true;
- Ensure registration is called from a single place (not inside pages/layouts).

6) Ensure only one render tree for tabs/sections
- Remove nested <Routes> from layouts and tab containers. Tabs should be simple links (Link to="…") and content rendered via nested routes declared at the top-level route file using <Outlet/>.
- Layout components must return only:
  <Header /><Outlet /><Footer />
  No wildcard routes or NotFound inside layouts or tab shells.

7) Keep exactly one catch‑all 404 route (at the end)
- In the main route file, list all concrete routes (user, admin, all subpages), then a single last route:
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
- Remove every other wildcard (“*”) route anywhere, including admin or tab layouts.
- Guards (auth/role) must not render NotFound; when blocked, render Unauthorized or redirect.

8) Add temporary detection to prove the fix (remove after)
- In App.tsx (top level):
  if ((window as any).__APP_MOUNTED__) console.error('APP_MOUNTED_TWICE');
  (window as any).__APP_MOUNTED__ = true;
- In NotFound.tsx temporarily:
  console.warn('NOTFOUND_RENDER', window.location.pathname);
- After fix, load a few pages: no APP_MOUNTED_TWICE logs; NOTFOUND_RENDER appears only on truly invalid URLs.

9) Run/deploy hygiene
- Ensure the run command launches only one server that serves the built app. Do not start both a dev server and a static server concurrently.
- Bump the service worker version, unregister it once, and clear site data; reload to drop any cached old shell that might duplicate content.

Acceptance criteria
- Each page (home, gallery, forum, amenities and its tabs, triathlon leaderboard, admin and all admin subpages) renders once—no duplicated sections.
- The 404 page shows only on invalid URLs; it never appears appended under valid pages.
- Console shows no APP_MOUNTED_TWICE; NOTFOUND_RENDER only on invalid paths.
- Network shows no unexpected 404s during normal navigation.

Deliverables to confirm in PR/console
- Screenshot or console logs showing no APP_MOUNTED_TWICE.
- List of removed duplicate mounts/routers/providers (files touched).
- Confirmation that only one catch‑all 404 remains at the end of the route tree.
- Service worker version bumped and verified.
