Issue Summary
After a rollback, subsequent code changes are not appearing in the Replit Preview or the deployed app. Even trivial edits (e.g., adding a new event category on the Events page) fail to surface at runtime. Standard remediations (hard reload, cache clear, unregister service worker, workspace restart) have not resolved the issue.

Objectives

Diagnose why current edits are not reflected in the running Replit instance and deployed artifact.

Provide a Replit-specific, minimal, reproducible diagnostic workflow.

Restore reliable build, preview, and deployment behavior.

Environment Artifacts Available on request

.replit and replit.nix (run command, environment)

package.json (scripts, build tool)

Service worker file(s) and registration code

Build tool config (Vite/Webpack)

Server entry (if applicable) and deploy configuration

Requested Guidance (Replit-specific)

Run/Preview pipeline

How to verify the Replit run command is serving the current build output (e.g., confirming hot-reload and file watchers are active).

Steps to detect and remediate when the Preview serves stale artifacts.

How to interpret Console output to confirm rebuilds on save.

Service worker and asset caching

Canonical versioning strategy on Replit to guarantee service worker updates (e.g., cache busting, skipWaiting/clientsClaim policy, cache name rotation).

Procedure to temporarily disable service worker registration in Replit Preview to eliminate caching as a variable, and steps to confirm active worker scope/state.

Deployment artifacts and cache

How to verify which commit/branch Deploy is using and trigger a clean, fresh deploy bundle.

Instructions to invalidate or clear any cached deploy/CDN assets tied to Replit Deploy.

Database/API validation within Replit

Commands to test API endpoints from the Replit Shell (e.g., curl/node) to create a new “event category,” validating write/read independently of the frontend.

How to surface and monitor CORS/auth errors in Replit logs and associate them with incoming requests.

Minimal reproduction and isolation

Exact steps to:
a) Add a trivial UI/text change and confirm it appears in Preview.
b) If not visible, isolate whether the failure is in build, service worker, or deploy by toggling one variable at a time (e.g., remove SW registration, serve directly from dev server, bypass bundler).

Recommended checkpoints to confirm each stage is using fresh assets (file hash checks, console markers, log timestamps).

Additional Context

Basic API/DB checks have been performed; functionality still blocked at the UI/feature level.

The problem began after a rollback; significant changes have been made since, so rolling back again is not feasible.

Please respond with:

Step-by-step instructions specific to Replit (including which panel to use: Console, Shell, Deploy, Nix logs).

Any known Replit caveats involving service workers, Preview, or Deploy caching.

If file inspection is needed, list exact files/sections and what to look for (e.g., .replit run = ["npm run dev"], Vite config for SW, cache names, deploy settings).

Goal
Restore the ability for current code edits to appear reliably in Preview and Deployed environments to meet the deployment deadline.
