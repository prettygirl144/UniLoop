Understood — the Directory subpage is only showing the signed‑in user. Here’s a copy‑paste prompt for Replit to implement the full classmates listing while still showing “Me” at the top.

Subject: Directory subpage — show full student list (classmates) with Roll Number and Batch, not just “me”

Goal
- Keep the top “My Profile” card (name/photo/email/roll/batch).
- Below it, render a searchable, paginated list of students from the Admin Student Directory (same batch by default, with filters to change).
- Data comes from the Admin-uploaded Student Directory store.

Implement exactly

1) Server: list endpoint(s)
- Add/confirm a read endpoint that returns directory rows (no PII beyond what’s needed):
  - GET /api/directory/list?batch=PGP%202025&page=1&limit=20&query=&section=&program=
  - Supports:
    - batch: default to the current user’s batch; if missing, return all.
    - query: case-insensitive substring match on name, email, rollNumber.
    - pagination: page, limit (max 50).
    - optional filters: program, section.
  - Response:
    {
      data: Array<{ id, fullName, email, rollNumber, batch, program?, section?, hostel? }>,
      total: number,
      page: number,
      limit: number
    }
- Authorization:
  - Any authenticated user can read list; optionally scope to same campus/tenant.
  - Write endpoints remain admin/staff only (RBAC unchanged).

2) Server: me endpoint remains
- GET /api/directory/me already returns joined fields for the signed‑in user (keep as-is for the top card).

3) Client: Directory subpage layout
- Top: “My Profile” card (existing) using /api/directory/me.
- Below: “Class Directory” section with:
  - Controls row:
    - Batch dropdown (default = my batch; also include “All”)
    - Search input (debounced 300 ms) → query param
  - List:
    - Paginated list (20 per page) using React Query with key:
      ['directory','list',{ batch, page, limit, query, section, program }]
    - Each row shows:
      - Avatar (from email gravatar if no photo)
      - fullName
      - rollNumber (monospace)
      - batch (muted)
      - optional program/section tags
  - Pagination footer with page/total; disable during fetch
  - Empty state: “No students found for this filter”

4) Client: default scoping and filters
- On first load, set batch filter to myBatch from /api/directory/me. If null, default to “All”.
- Preserve state in URL (e.g., /directory?batch=PGP%202025&q=rahul&page=2) so reloads keep filters.

5) Performance and UX
- Debounce search input (300 ms).
- Use keepPreviousData for pagination to avoid list flicker.
- Limit fields rendered to what’s needed (no admin-only columns).
- Optional: client-side alphabet quick jump.

6) Security/privacy
- Do not expose phone numbers or sensitive data unless policy allows.
- If policy requires scoping to same batch by default, allow “All” only for admin/staff; otherwise keep accessible to all students per your policy.

7) Testing checklist
- Log in as a student:
  - “My Profile” shows roll/batch.
  - Class Directory lists classmates in the same batch.
  - Search by name/email/roll works.
  - Changing batch filter shows other batches (if allowed).
  - Pagination moves through results correctly.
- Log in as admin/staff:
  - Same behavior; may see “All batches” by default if desired.

8) Files to change/add (adapt paths)
- Server
  - routes/directory.list.ts (new)
  - routes/directory.me.ts (already present)
- Client
  - pages/DirectoryPage.tsx (subpage opened from Home button)
    - Add filter controls, list, pagination
  - api/directory.ts
    - getMe()
    - list({ batch, page, limit, query, section, program })

Acceptance criteria
- Directory subpage shows:
  - Top: “My Profile” (me).
  - Below: a searchable, paginated list of other students (by default, same batch).
- The list reflects Admin uploads and supports batch filter + search + pagination.
