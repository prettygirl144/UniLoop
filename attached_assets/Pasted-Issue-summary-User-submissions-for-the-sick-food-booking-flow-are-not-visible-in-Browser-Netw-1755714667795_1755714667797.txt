Issue summary
User submissions for the “sick food” booking flow are not visible in:

Browser Network responses (suspected)

Server runtime logs

Database tables/collections

Objective
Provide a Replit-focused diagnostic and remediation workflow to determine whether bookings are being blocked at:

Client → API (request not sent, CORS, SW interception)

API route (handler not invoked, payload/validation failure)

Database layer (insert rejected, wrong schema/DB, uncommitted transaction)

Requested actions (step-by-step, Replit-specific)

Confirm API requests reach the running process

Instruct how to open and monitor the Replit Console in real time while submitting the booking.

Add temporary structured logs around the booking route:

On request entry: method, path, requestId, userId (if present).

Body snapshot (safe fields only).

Before DB insert: payload fields validated.

After DB call: insertedId/rowCount.

On error: full stack trace.

Ensure logs flush immediately (no buffering).

Validate client → server path and CORS

Confirm the app’s resolved API base URL in the current run (print it at server startup and in client console).

If CORS blocks are detected, add the app origin to allowed origins; log the Origin and CORS decision per request.

Eliminate service worker interference

Temporarily disable service worker registration in the client during troubleshooting, or configure the SW fetch handler to:

Never cache or short-circuit POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE.

Bypass cache for requests to /bookings endpoints.

Instruct to bump the SW version and verify activation to ensure the new behavior is active.

Direct endpoint verification from Replit Shell

Provide a command to invoke the booking endpoint with a minimal valid payload using curl from within the Replit Shell.

Expectation: 200/201 with insertedId/rowCount in JSON.

If this fails, the issue is server/DB-side; proceed to step 5.

Database connectivity and target verification

Log the effective DB connection parameters at server startup (host, db/schema name — redact secrets).

Add a quick health check route (GET /db/health) that performs a trivial read to confirm the server can access the intended DB.

Run a direct DB query in Replit Shell to list the last 10 bookings ordered by created_at DESC to confirm whether inserts land in the expected table/collection.

Schema and validation alignment

Ensure server-side validation matches the client payload (required fields: e.g., bookingType='sick_food', date/time, user/device identifier, quantity, notes).

If validation fails, return explicit 4xx with human-readable details and log them; do not swallow errors.

Authentication/authorization handling

Confirm that the route accepts and validates the Authorization header if required.

If the token is missing/expired, return 401/403 and emit a clear log line; ensure the client surfaces the error (avoid silent failures).

Instrumentation to trace individual bookings

Generate a requestId on the client (e.g., bk-<timestamp>) and include it in payload.

Log requestId consistently in server logs and return it in the API response.

Optionally store requestId in the DB row/document for cross-layer correlation.

Replit run/deploy consistency checks

Verify the run command serves the current build and API simultaneously, or clarify split processes if applicable.

If using Deploys, confirm the deployed artifact is current and not serving stale assets (document steps to force a fresh deploy and clear CDN cache, if any).

Provide guidance to quickly switch the .replit run command to a production-serve mode for realistic testing, then revert.

Deliverables

A minimal diagnostic checklist visible in the Console output (what to look for per submission).

Exact Shell commands to:

Hit the booking endpoint with a sample payload.

Query the DB for most recent bookings.

Concrete instructions to adjust CORS, service worker fetch behavior, and logging so that the next booking attempt definitively shows up in either logs or DB, or returns a precise error.

If file inspection is needed, specify the exact snippets to share:

Server route for bookings (handler signature and insert logic).

Service worker fetch event code touching POSTs.

Environment/run configuration (.replit, run command).

DB client initialization (redacted connection values).

Any proxy configuration affecting API_BASE_URL.

Goal
Within one test submission, determine the failing layer and provide a targeted fix so that “sick food” bookings reliably appear in server logs and are persisted in the intended database.
