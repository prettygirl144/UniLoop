Sure! Here's a detailed **Replit prompt-engineered instruction** for building the **newly added functionality** based on your latest input:

---

**Prompt to Replit:**

> Build a mobile-first full-stack app (Android-first, responsive for iOS) using React Native + Firebase/Express that supports the following extensions to the existing MVP:
>
> ### 🔁 Multi-Account Switcher
>
> Allow a logged-in user (via OAuth2.0 Google Sign-In) to:
>
> * Link multiple accounts to a single session (e.g., Student + Committee/Club).
> * Switch between roles (Student, Committee/Club) from a dropdown or profile section without logging out.
> * Each role switch should load distinct permission sets and dashboards without needing a full reload.
> * Store active role in local storage or React context.
>
> ### 🧾 Login/Logout Management
>
> * OAuth 2.0 login via institutional Google email.
> * JWT-based session persistence with refresh tokens.
> * Logout should clear session and allow account re-login from landing page.
> * Provide a sample `admin@institute.edu` account as default admin (can edit roles and permissions).
>
> ### 🖼 Media Upload for Events & Forum
>
> * Extend Event Creation and Forum Post forms to support:
>
>   * Upload of multiple media types (images/videos).
>   * Preview before posting.
>   * Store in Firebase Storage or mock upload path.
>
> ### 🗂 Media Gallery (Optimized for Storage)
>
> * Instead of direct storage, integrate with Google Drive:
>
>   * Embed folders using Drive’s public shareable “view-only” iframe links.
>   * Allow folders to be categorized (e.g., Events, Celebrations, Competitions).
>   * Admin can update folder links via a dashboard form.
>
> ### 🛡 Role-Based Permissions (Enhanced)
>
> * Admin has superior access:
>
>   * Override access to all features regardless of permission toggles.
>   * Full control over assigning feature access to any email.
> * User permission sets should be defined per email and per feature (Calendar, Gallery, Attendance, Hostel, Dining, Forum Mod, etc.).
> * Admin panel should support visual toggling of permissions with update functionality.
>
> ### 📲 UX Requirements
>
> * Clean, modern UI optimized for mobile.
> * Use card-style interface and bottom nav bar.
> * Prioritize modular structure (e.g., separate components for Calendar, Forum, Account Switcher).
> * Ensure UI state resets appropriately on account switch.
>
> Implement all features with scalability and modularity in mind for future expansion.
