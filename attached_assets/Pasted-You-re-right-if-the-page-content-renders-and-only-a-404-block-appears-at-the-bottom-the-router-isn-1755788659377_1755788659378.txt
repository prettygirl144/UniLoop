You’re right: if the page content renders and only a 404 block appears at the bottom, the router isn’t the root cause. That pattern almost always comes from one of these two bugs:

1) A NotFound component is rendered unconditionally in the layout
- Example: Layout.jsx returns <Outlet /> followed by <NotFound /> (or a fallback) instead of rendering NotFound only on the wildcard route.
- Or a secondary nested route tree has its own “*” route that’s always mounted under the page.

2) A global error boundary/Route fallback is mounted alongside content
- An ErrorBoundary, Suspense fallback, or nested <Routes> tree renders a NotFound fragment in parallel to the main content due to a mis-placed wildcard.

Give Replit these exact fixes to replicate what worked on “/” across all sections.

Subject: Remove stray NotFound rendering appended under valid pages

Actions

1) Inspect shared layout components
- Open the layouts used by non-home pages (e.g., AppLayout, AmenitiesLayout, ForumLayout).
- Ensure they render only:
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
- Confirm there is no <NotFound />, <Route path="*">, or “404” JSX inside any layout. Those must live only in the top-level router config.

2) Consolidate to a single top-level wildcard
- In App.tsx (top-level <Routes>):
  - Make the last route the only catch-all:
    <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
- Remove any nested “*” routes in child <Routes> (e.g., inside AmenitiesLayout or Forum routes). Nested wildcards often render in addition to matched children, causing the extra 404 block.

3) Fix nested route trees that duplicate the router
- If a child page creates its own <Routes> under content, convert it to nested <Route> definitions in the parent tree, not a new router instance.
- Never nest BrowserRouter inside pages; there should be exactly one router provider.

4) Guard/ProtectedRoute must return only children when allowed
- For protected sections, ensure:
  return isLoading ? <Spinner/> : isAuthenticated ? children : <Unauthorized/>;
- Do not return <NotFound/> for unauthorized; that wrongly appends a 404 under valid pages.

5) Remove conditional NotFound fragments
- Search the codebase for “NotFound” and “404”. Delete any usage that is not the single top-level wildcard route.
- Also check any generic PageContainer that might have a fallback like {children || <NotFound/>} — replace with explicit checks at call sites.

6) Verify with a quick test component
- Temporarily add in each layout:
  console.debug('Layout render', location.pathname);
  Ensure the NotFound component logs only when visiting an invalid path.

7) Service worker: ensure it isn’t injecting an old shell
- Bump SW version; DevTools → Application → Unregister SW and Clear site data; reload once.
- This prevents an old HTML shell (containing a NotFound block) from being appended.

Acceptance criteria
- On /gallery, /forum, /amenities, etc., NotFound never renders in the console.
- The extra 404 block at the bottom disappears on all pages.
- Visiting a truly invalid path (e.g., /amenities/xyz) shows the 404 page by itself (not appended under content).

If you share App.tsx routes plus one layout (e.g., AmenitiesLayout) and the NotFound component, I can mark the exact lines to delete/move.
