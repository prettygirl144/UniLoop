Subject: Add dynamic “Triathlon News Snippets” on Home → Triathlon subpage (combine Events + Forum posts tagged “Triathlon”)

Goal
- On the Triathlon subpage (which already shows the leaderboard), add a compact “News Snippets” section that automatically lists the latest 5 items combined from:
  - Events/Calendar items tagged with the Triathlon category
  - Forum posts (Community + Official Announcements) tagged “Triathlon”
- Items should be deduplicated, sorted by createdAt/startsAt descending, and link to the original detail pages.

Requirements

UI/UX
- Placement: below the existing Triathlon Leaderboard block on the Home → Triathlon subpage.
- Section header: “Triathlon News”
- List of up to 5 snippets, each row shows:
  - Source pill: Event or Forum
  - Title (one line, ellipsized)
  - Meta: relative time (e.g., “2h ago”) + absolute date (e.g., “22 Aug 2025”)
  - Optional: small icon (calendar for Events, chat/megaphone for Forum/Announcement)
- Click row to navigate to the event detail or forum thread.
- Empty state: “No recent triathlon updates yet.”
- “View all” small link goes to:
  - A filtered listing page for each source using the Triathlon tag (optional, if listings exist).

Data and API

Add two read endpoints if not present (or reuse existing with filters):
- Events:
  - GET /api/events?tag=triathlon&limit=5
  - Response items need: id, title, startsAt (or createdAt), url/path, source: 'event'
- Forum (community posts + official announcements):
  - GET /api/forum?tag=triathlon&limit=5&scope=all
  - Response items need: id, title, createdAt, url/path, source: 'forum' | 'announcement'

Aggregation client hook
- Create a React Query hook useTriathlonSnippets():
  - Fetch in parallel the two lists above (limit 5 each).
  - Transform to a unified shape:
    { id, title, date: startsAt || createdAt, source: 'event'|'forum'|'announcement', href }
  - Deduplicate by id+source (in case cross-posted).
  - Sort by date desc.
  - Slice to 5 final items.
  - Cache key: ['triathlon','snippets'] with staleTime: 60s.

Server support (if filtering not available)
- Add server-side tag filtering for both endpoints:
  - Events: WHERE tags includes 'triathlon' (case-insensitive) OR category = 'Triathlon'
  - Forum: WHERE tags includes 'triathlon' across both community posts and announcements; scope=all returns both categories or union them server-side.
- Index tags field for faster lookups if dataset grows.

Implementation steps

Frontend
1) Component: TriathlonNews.tsx
- Uses useTriathlonSnippets hook.
- Renders the header and list UI described above.
- Handles loading skeleton (5 placeholder rows) and empty state.
- Optional dev diagnostic: console.debug with counts from each source.

2) Add TriathlonNews right under the leaderboard in the Triathlon subpage component.

3) Link targets
- For each item, construct route:
  - Events → /events/:id (or existing event detail path)
  - Forum/Announcements → /forum/:threadId (or /announcements/:id if separate)
- Ensure navigate() uses SPA links (<Link to={href}>).

Backend
4) Extend events list to accept tag and limit params (if not present).
5) Extend forum list to accept tag, scope=all, and limit params (if not present).
6) Return only fields required by the snippets; keep admin-only fields out.
7) Add requestId logging and result counts for observability.

Performance and caching
8) Limit to 5 results per source; do the final sort client-side.
9) staleTime: 60s; refetchOnWindowFocus: false to avoid excessive requests.
10) Ensure service worker is network-first for this small feed or uses a short max-age.

Acceptance criteria
- Triathlon subpage shows the “Triathlon News” list beneath the leaderboard.
- It displays up to 5 most recent items across Events + Forum/Announcements tagged Triathlon, correctly sorted by date.
- Clicking an item routes to the correct detail page.
- If no triathlon-tagged content exists, the empty state appears.
- Performance: initial render fetch completes quickly; no flicker after cache warmup.
- Admin and non-admin users see the same read-only feed (no moderation actions).

Files to add/change (adjust paths)
- client/features/triathlon/TriathlonNews.tsx (new)
- client/features/triathlon/hooks/useTriathlonSnippets.ts (new)
- client/api/events.ts: add listByTag(tag, limit)
- client/api/forum.ts: add listByTag(tag, limit, scope='all')
- server/routes/events.list.ts: support tag and limit
- server/routes/forum.list.ts: support tag, scope=all, and limit

Notes
- Tag value normalized as lowercase “triathlon”; server should case-insensitively match “Triathlon”.
- If events use startsAt while forum uses createdAt, use the best available date for sorting; include both fields in the transformation.
