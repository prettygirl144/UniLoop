Subject: Directory subpage on Home — show Roll Number + Batch from Admin Student Directory and ensure it updates reliably

Context
- The Home page has a “Directory” button that opens the Directory subpage.
- Admin uploads a Student Directory (CSV). Each user should see Roll Number and Batch pulled from that source.
- Currently the Directory subpage still shows placeholders or stale data.

Objective
- Make the Directory subpage fetch from a joined “me” API that includes rollNumber and batch from the Student Directory.
- Ensure user–directory linking happens on login and after admin uploads.
- Eliminate stale UI by refetching/invalidating caches and avoiding service-worker stale JSON.

Tasks (implement all)

1) Confirm/standardize the joined API used by the subpage
- Ensure an authenticated read endpoint exists that returns joined fields for the signed-in user:
  GET /api/directory/me → { name, email, photoUrl, rollNumber, batch, program?, section? }
- If this endpoint exists already, verify it reads rollNumber and batch from the Student Directory record linked to the user (not only from denormalized user fields).
- If denormalized fields are present on the user, keep them updated, but prefer reading through to the Student Directory record for accuracy.

2) Link users to the Student Directory on login and via backfill
- On auth success (login/signup), attempt linkage:
  - Match directory by emailLower = user.email.toLowerCase().
  - If not found and user provided a roll number, match by rollUpper = rollNumber.toUpperCase().
- On match, persist on user:
  - directoryId, rollNumber, batch (optional denormalized copy).
- Add a one-time backfill job that links existing users by emailLower.
- Add concise logs: “directory.link success by email/roll” or “directory.link not_found”.

3) Update the Directory subpage (Home → Directory button destination)
- Ensure the subpage fetches /api/directory/me directly (do not rely on a stale auth context).
- Use a stable client cache key (e.g., ['directory','me']) with:
  - staleTime: 0 (during rollout) and refetchOnWindowFocus: true
- Render values safely with fallbacks:
  - Roll Number: data?.rollNumber ?? '—'
  - Batch: data?.batch ?? '—'
- Remove any early-return conditions that hide the fields when values are empty.
- Show a subtle note when not linked: “Not found in directory. Contact Admin.” (no blocking).

4) Invalidate and refresh after changes
- After successful login/linking, explicitly invalidate ['directory','me'] so the subpage shows fresh data immediately.
- After an Admin directory upload completes, trigger a lightweight “directory cache bust”:
  - Option A: increment a server-side version number and return it from /api/directory/me; include that version in the client query key.
  - Option B: expose an admin-only POST /api/directory/invalidate that bumps a server cache version; client key includes that version.

5) Prevent stale data from the service worker
- During development and initial rollout, set network-first for GET /api/directory/me.
- Bump the service-worker version and ensure it does not cache old JSON for this endpoint.
- Provide a one-time instruction in the deployment notes to clear old SW caches.

6) CSV normalization on upload (if not already)
- On Admin upload, normalize:
  - emailLower = trim(email).toLowerCase()
  - rollUpper = trim(rollNumber).toUpperCase()
- Maintain quick indices:
  - by email: dir:index:email:{emailLower} → studentId
  - by roll: dir:index:roll:{rollUpper} → studentId

7) QA checklist (must pass)
- Log out → log in as a user present in the uploaded directory:
  - Open Home → Directory subpage via the “Directory” button.
  - It should show correct Roll Number and Batch.
- Change that user’s batch in the Admin CSV and re-upload:
  - Trigger the cache invalidation step.
  - Reopen the Directory subpage; batch reflects the change.
- User not in directory:
  - Sees “—” values and the non-blocking note; no errors.
- Hard reload and navigate back; still correct (no SW-stale responses).

Deliverables (files to touch; adjust paths to repo)
- Server
  - directory.me endpoint (ensure joined read + returns rollNumber and batch)
  - auth login callback/linker (email/roll match + save linkage)
  - admin upload handler (CSV normalize + upsert + indices)
  - optional directory cache version/invalidate
- Client
  - Directory subpage component (Home → Directory):
    - Fetch /api/directory/me
    - Render Roll Number + Batch with fallbacks
    - Invalidate/refetch on login and after admin upload success (if this page is open)
  - Query client wiring to set staleTime/refetchOnWindowFocus
  - Optional: small “Linked to student directory” dev-only debug line in console

Acceptance criteria
>>>>>>> 59dec97e5be7abb329e79d6f7171866c4e3f255b
- The Directory subpage (opened via Home → “Directory” button) displays the user’s Roll Number and Batch sourced from the Admin Student Directory, updates after admin re-uploads, and never shows stale values due to caching.
