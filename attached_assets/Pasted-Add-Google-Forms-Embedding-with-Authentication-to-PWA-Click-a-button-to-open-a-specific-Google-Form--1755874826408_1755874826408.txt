Add Google Forms Embedding with Authentication to PWA
Click a button to open a specific Google Form embedded within the app

Automatically authenticate the user's email in the embedded Google Form based on their current browser session OR allow them to authenticate with the correct Gmail account within the embedding itself

Specific Requirements
Google Form Integration

Given an authenticated user in the PWA

When they click the "Fill Form" button

Then the Google Form should open as an embedded iframe within the PWA

And the form should either:

Automatically use the user's authenticated email from the browser session, OR

Allow the user to authenticate with their Gmail account within the embedded frame

Technical Specifications

Form URL: https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLScdAqB_-aEvPRBh4xJVmSPDv9tuYJWFAimPbspKZXwnLHEwFQ/viewform?pli=1

Integration Method: Embedded iframe within the PWA interface

PWA Features: Maintain offline capability where possible, responsive design for mobile devices

Implementation Plan Request
Please assess this enhancement and outline the necessary steps to implement this functionality. Consider:

Authentication Architecture: How to implement secure email/Google OAuth authentication in the PWA

Google Forms Integration: Best practices for embedding Google Forms with authentication handling

Session Management: How to maintain authentication state between the PWA and embedded Google Form

Cross-Origin Considerations: Handle any CORS or iframe security restrictions

Mobile PWA Optimization: Ensure the embedded form works well on mobile devices

User Experience: Seamless flow between PWA authentication and form filling

Technical Considerations
Use modern web standards and PWA best practices

Implement proper error handling for authentication failures

Consider fallback options if iframe embedding has limitations

Ensure compliance with Google's OAuth policies and Terms of Service

Handle edge cases like session timeout or authentication conflicts

Success Criteria
Google Form opens embedded within the app interface

Authentication state is properly managed between PWA and form

The solution works consistently across different browsers and mobile devices

Form submissions are successful and properly attributed to the authenticated user
