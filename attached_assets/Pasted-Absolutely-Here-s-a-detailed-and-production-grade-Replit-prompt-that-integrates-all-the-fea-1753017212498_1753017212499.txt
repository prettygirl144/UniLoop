Absolutely. Here's a detailed and **production-grade Replit prompt** that integrates **all** the features you specified across prior messages, ensures **granular role-based permissions**, and follows **Replit Prompt Engineering principles**. This prompt is suitable for generating an Android-first (but cross-platform) **React Native (Expo)** app with a clean, modern UI and extensible architecture.

---

## 🛠️ REPLIT PROMPT: Build *Campus Connect* – Modular University Utility & Comms App (MVP)

---

### 📱 Platform:

Build a mobile-first, responsive **React Native app** using **Expo**, with UI components styled cleanly using libraries like NativeBase or Tailwind-compatible solutions. The app should prioritize **Android**, but work on **iOS** as well.

---

## 🔧 Functional Modules (MVP Scope)

Implement the following **modular features**, scoped for an MVP:

---

### 1. 🔐 Authentication & Role Management

* **OAuth 2.0** login using **institutional email only** (Google preferred)
* On successful login, fetch: `name`, `email`, and assign default role: `student`
* Generate and persist **JWT token** with `email`, `role`, `permissions` (frontend + backend)
* Roles:

  * `student` (default)
  * `admin`
  * `committee_club` (custom granular access)
* All new signups are `student` with view-only access
* **Admin Control Panel** to assign feature-specific access by email

  * e.g. `user1@domain.edu`: `calendar: true`, `gallery: false`, `diningHostel: true`

```json
{
  "role": "committee_club",
  "permissions": {
    "calendar": true,
    "attendance": false,
    "gallery": false,
    "forumMod": false,
    "diningHostel": true
  }
}
```

---

### 2. 📣 Communication Hub

* Main Home Screen feed with **latest announcements** (card-style)
* Posts are created manually in-app by users with `postCreation` access:

  * Title
  * Description
  * Optional Image/Attachment
  * **Tags**: `Academic`, `Event`, `Admin`
  * Optional RSVP toggle (saves locally)
* **Admin/Committee & Club** can post; students view only
* Option to integrate **sync to email groups** (future module)

---

### 3. 🗓️ Events Calendar

* Event listing in calendar format (grid or scrollable FlatList)
* **Event card** includes:

  * Title, Date & Time, Location
  * Host Committee/Club
  * RSVP status (if enabled)
  * Category Tag
* **Creation form (access-controlled)**:

  * Form fields: title, date, time, location, host, RSVP toggle
  * Check for **location-time clashes** → only allow same-time if location differs
  * Auto-sync RSVP’d events with local device calendar (optional)
* Event blocks **overwrite existing blocks** if at the same location & time

---

### 4. ✅ Attendance Logging

* Only **POCs/authorized committee/club/admin users** see this module
* Select Event from dropdown
* Pull attendee list using:

  * Preloaded section-wise student DB (dropdown)
  * Manual Excel upload (CSV → name/email)
  * RSVP responses (auto-populated list)
* UI: Simple tick-box check-in interface
* Data stored as:

  ```json
  {
    "eventId": "xyz",
    "attendees": ["email1", "email2"],
    "timestamp": "..."
  }
  ```

---

### 5. 🍽️ Dining & Hostel Grievance Section

* Mess Menu (JSON/static API based)
* Sick Food Booking:

  * Student fills form for specific day & meal
* ITC Grievance & Menu Issues:

  * Predefined dropdown options (e.g., undercooked, item missing)
  * Text input for custom feedback
* Hostel Leave Form:

  * Student fills date-wise leave
  * Simulates mail to office (mock with toast/confirmation modal)
* Only `admin/ITC` role has access to update menu

---

### 6. 💬 Community Forum

* Forum Feed:

  * Anonymous or Named posts
  * Post types: Text, Image, Video (via file picker or URL)
  * Reactions: 👍 ❤️ 😂
  * Comment system (threaded or flat)
* Post Form:

  * Title, Content, Optional Media, Anonymous toggle
* Admin Panel:

  * If post is flagged (by reaction threshold or manual flag):

    * Admin sees real poster (even for anonymous)
    * Admin can: `hide`, `delete`, `warn` (mock action for now)

---

### 7. 👥 Student Directory

* Searchable directory with:

  * Name, Email, Programme, Batch
* “Ping” button → Opens short message form (not full chat)
* Students can view/edit their profile (avatar, pronouns, phone optional)

---

### 8. 🔐 Admin Permissions Manager

* UI Panel for Admin:

  * Search by email or select from user list
  * Toggle access to:

    * Calendar (create/edit)
    * Dining & Hostel
    * Attendance
    * Gallery (upload access)
    * Forum Moderator
  * Save to backend (mocked)

```json
{
  "email": "abc@college.edu",
  "permissions": {
    "calendar": true,
    "attendance": true,
    "gallery": false,
    "forumMod": false,
    "diningHostel": true
  }
}
```

---

### 9. 🧩 Other Features & Behavior

* 🔐 **RBAC enforcement** on frontend (UI-level visibility) and backend (route access)
* 🧱 Modular code: Keep features in isolated folders (e.g., `/calendar`, `/attendance`, `/forum`)
* 🔄 LocalStorage for basic caching (e.g. RSVP status)
* 🔔 Optional push notification or toast alert for updates

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React Native + Expo
* **Auth**: Google OAuth 2.0
* **State Management**: Context API or Redux
* **Backend (Mock or Express API)**:

  * Node.js + Express or Firebase Functions
  * JWT-based authentication
  * JSON files or Firebase for data store

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

* Clean mobile UI, responsive and modular
* MVP should run on Android & iOS simulators
* Students only see view-based modules
* Admin/Committee/Club members can manage based on assigned permissions
* All data actions gated via permission layer

---

Let me know if you'd like:

* UI wireframes for each module
* Firebase schema template
* API endpoints definition
* Replit file structure guide for this app
