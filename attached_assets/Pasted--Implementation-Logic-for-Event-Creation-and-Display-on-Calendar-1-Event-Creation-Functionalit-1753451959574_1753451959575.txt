# Implementation Logic for Event Creation and Display on Calendar

## 1. Event Creation Functionality

* Implement event creation functionality on the *Calendar Page* using the provided *New Event Configuration*.
* Ensure all existing input fields (e.g., Event Title, Date, Start Time, Description) are fully operational, correctly validated, and stored.

## 2. Additional Input Fields

### a. Batch and Section Integration

* On the *Admin Page, add a new input field labeled **"Batch and Sections"*.
* Fetch available batches and their respective sections from the existing *Student Directory* on Admin page.
* Enable admins to select multiple batches and sections for event attendees.
* Validate selections to ensure accurate event attendee mapping.

### b. Mandatory Event Toggle

* Introduce a new toggle input field labeled *"Is Event Mandatory?"* within the New Event Configuration.
* Allow admins to specify whether the event is mandatory or optional.

### c. Event End Time and Duration

* Add a new input field labeled *"End Time"* in the event creation form.
* Automatically calculate and display the event duration based on Start and End times.
* Validate input to ensure End Time is logically after Start Time.

## 3. Display Logic on User Calendar

### a. Event Visibility

* Events created by admins must appear on the calendar of *all users*.
* Clicking on an event should open a modal or details panel clearly indicating if the current user is among the intended attendees based on their Batch and Section.
* If a user is *not* an attendee, clearly display a message like: "You are not registered for this event."

### b. Mandatory vs. Non-Mandatory Events

* Visually distinguish mandatory and non-mandatory events on user calendars.

  * *Mandatory events*: Use a prominent color or icon (e.g., red dot or exclamation).
  * *Non-mandatory events*: Use a neutral or softer indicator (e.g., grey dot or neutral icon).
* Clearly show mandatory status within event details for quick reference.

## 4. Validation and Error Handling

* Implement comprehensive client-side and server-side validation for all input fields.
* Provide clear and user-friendly error messages if validation fails.
* Ensure reliable synchronization between Admin inputs and User calendar displays.

## 5. Technical Integration

* Ensure compatibility with existing Replit application architecture.
* Modularize all added functionality clearly, using separate files/components where applicable.
* Document code clearly for ease of future maintenance and enhancements.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

* Test rigorously across multiple use-cases:

  * Creating events with varying batches and sections.
  * Mandatory vs. Non-mandatory events.
  * Events spanning different time durations.
* Validate correct calendar rendering and attendee visibility across multiple user roles.

Follow these structured guidelines meticulously for implementation on Replit.
