Context

Stack: PWA frontend + backend on Replit

Database: Replit Database (key–value store)

Goal: Add and persist two new fields across the full flow and surface them in Records and CSV export.

New fields

phoneNumber: string (required), 10–15 digits or E.164 (+…).

parcelMode: enum('dine_in','takeaway') (required)

UI labels:

“Have food in the mess itself” → dine_in

“Takeaway through friends” → takeaway

Acceptance criteria

Form displays the two fields with validation and helpful error messages.

POST payload includes phoneNumber and parcelMode.

Backend persists them in Replit DB and returns them in responses.

GET lists and details include both fields.

Records table and CSV export show both fields.

Existing bookings remain compatible; missing fields render with sensible defaults.

Implementation instructions

Data model in Replit Database

Each booking is stored under a unique key, e.g., bookings:{id}

Also maintain an index list key: bookings:index = JSON array of booking ids (append-only)

Booking object must include the new fields:
{
id, createdAt, userId, ...,
phoneNumber: string,
parcelMode: 'dine_in' | 'takeaway'
}

Backend: create and list handlers

Create (POST /api/sick-food/bookings)

Validate:

phoneNumber: required; /^[+0-9]{10,15}$/; trim; store as string

parcelMode: required; one of ['dine_in','takeaway'] (default: 'dine_in')

Generate id: e.g., bk-<timestamp>-<random>

Write flow:

set(bookings:${id}, JSON.stringify(booking))

get('bookings:index') → append id → set back

Response: 201 with the full booking object, including phoneNumber and parcelMode

List (GET /api/sick-food/bookings)

Read ids from bookings:index ([] if missing)

Fetch each bookings:{id}; parse JSON

Apply filters if present (date, user scope); do not drop fields

Return consistent shape:
{ data: Booking[], total: number }

Detail (GET /api/sick-food/bookings/:id)

Return the single booking object with the two fields

Frontend form (React)

Add inputs:

Phone Number (required)

inputMode="tel", pattern="^[+0-9]{10,15}$"

Inline error: “Enter a valid phone number (10–15 digits; + allowed).”

Food parcel (required)

Radio group:

“Have food in the mess itself” value="dine_in"

“Takeaway through friends” value="takeaway"

Default selection: dine_in

Submit payload must include { phoneNumber, parcelMode }

Block submission until both validations pass

React Query integration

Mutation (create):

Sends the two fields

On success, invalidate the exact list query key used by Records to refetch

List query (Records):

Accept and render shape { data, total }

Defensive parsing if existing code expects an array:
const rows = Array.isArray(json) ? json : json?.data ?? [];

Stale time: keep 0 during testing

Records table and CSV export

Add columns:

Phone Number: text; display “—” if missing

Parcel Mode: map dine_in → “Mess”, takeaway → “Takeaway”

CSV headers: Phone Number, Parcel Mode with same mappings

Backwards compatibility and migrations

Existing stored bookings (without fields) must continue to render:

phoneNumber: treat as null → render “—”

parcelMode: null/undefined → treat as 'dine_in' for display

Do not mutate existing records in place; only apply defaults at read/render

Diagnostics

Log on create: requestId, masked phone (last 4 digits), parcelMode, saved key

Log on list: total ids in bookings:index, total after filters, sample record keys

Return requestId in responses for UI correlation

QA steps to confirm completion

Create a booking:

phoneNumber: +911234567890

parcelMode: takeaway

Verify:

API response includes the two fields

Replit DB contains bookings:{id} with those fields and the id is appended to bookings:index

Records table shows both columns populated

CSV export includes both fields

Creating a booking triggers list invalidation and the new row appears without manual refresh
