My React app on Replit is showing a white screen and throwing repeated `Invalid hook call` errors in the console, particularly from `AuthContext.tsx` and `use-toast.ts`. These are the exact problems I need you to diagnose and fix step by step:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Errors:
- `Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component` (for `useQueryClient`, `useContext`, `useState`, etc.)
- Errors happen in `<AuthProvider>` and `<Toaster>` components
- `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')`
- `WebSocket` errors including: `wss://localhost:undefined` and failed connections

---

### ‚úÖ Please investigate and fix the following:

1. **Hook usage in `AuthProvider` and `Toaster`:**
   - Check `AuthContext.tsx` and `toaster.tsx` for improper use of hooks like `useContext`, `useQuery`, or `useState` **outside** of valid React function components.
   - Ensure all hooks are inside valid function components or custom hooks‚Äînot inside conditions, plain functions, or outside the React tree.

2. **React version mismatch or duplicate installs:**
   - Check `package.json` for mismatched versions of `react` and `react-dom`. They must match exactly.
   - Run `npm ls react` and `npm ls react-dom` to ensure there are **not multiple versions** installed in `node_modules`.

3. **Check for multiple React instances:**
   - Confirm that no subdependencies are shipping their own version of React.
   - Ensure you don‚Äôt have both `react` and `@vitejs/plugin-react` loading different instances.

4. **Fix provider hierarchy:**
   - Confirm that `QueryClientProvider` is correctly wrapping everything that uses `useQuery`, especially `AuthProvider`.
   - Make sure `Toaster` is only using `useToast` **inside** a valid React tree and that `ToastProvider` (if any) is also correctly mounted.

5. **Fix WebSocket errors:**
   - Investigate why `wss://localhost:undefined` is being generated. This is likely due to an undefined port/token or misconfigured `env` or `socketURL`.
   - Either fix the URL construction logic or use a valid environment variable.

6. **Cleanup & reload:**
   - Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` (or `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
   - Run a clean reinstall (`npm install` or `pnpm install`)
   - Restart the server and test again.

üîÅ After fixing the above, confirm that:
- The white screen is gone.
- No more hook errors in `AuthContext` or `Toaster`.
- App loads without WebSocket or `useContext`/`useState` errors.

Make only necessary edits‚Äîdo not rewrite unrelated parts of the codebase. Just diagnose and patch the exact issues above.
