Subject: Stop double-render across the entire PWA (one mount, one router, no duplicate providers)

Symptoms
- Every page renders twice (all sections duplicated). 404 card sometimes appears under valid pages.
- Must ensure a single React mount, a single router tree, and no duplicate global providers or SW registration.

Do all steps below.

1) Enforce a single mount and render
- index.html: keep exactly one root container:
  <div id="root"></div>
  Remove any other root-like containers used to mount App.
- index.tsx (or main.tsx):
  - Create and render once:
    const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
    const app = <App />;
    root.render(import.meta.env.DEV ? <React.StrictMode>{app}</React.StrictMode> : app);
  - Search the repository for createRoot( or ReactDOM.render( and delete any additional mounts.

2) Keep exactly one router provider
- There must be only one BrowserRouter/RouterProvider in the whole app (top-level only).
- Search for BrowserRouter, HashRouter, RouterProvider across src. Remove any instances inside pages/layouts/tab components/admin shells.

3) Ensure only one instance of each global provider
- QueryClientProvider, Redux Provider, ThemeProvider, Toast/Modal providers should wrap App once at the top shell only.
- Remove duplicated providers from layouts or pages.

4) Remove nested route trees from layouts/tabs
- Layouts (AppLayout, AmenitiesLayout, ForumLayout, GalleryLayout, TriathlonLayout, AdminLayout, any TabbedLayout) must render only:
  <Header /><Outlet /><Footer />
- Delete any <Routes> declared inside layouts/tab containers. Define all routes at the top router file using nested routes with <Outlet/>.

5) Keep a single catch-all 404 route
- In the main route file, list all concrete routes (user + admin + subpages), then one last route:
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
- Remove all other wildcard (“*”) routes from nested trees.
- Guards must not render NotFound; when blocked, render Unauthorized or redirect.

6) Guard dev re-invocations and side effects
- StrictMode only in dev (already in step 1). Production should never double-invoke.
- Fix effects that append DOM without cleanup (toasts/modals/banners/portals):
  useEffect(() => {
    const el = document.createElement('div');
    document.body.appendChild(el);
    return () => document.body.removeChild(el);
  }, []);
- Ensure any portal/toast root is created once globally, not per page.

7) Prevent double service-worker registration
- Register SW from a single place and guard:
  if ((window as any).__SW_REGISTERED__) return;
  (window as any).__SW_REGISTERED__ = true;

8) Ensure only one server instance serves the app
- .replit run: start either your Express server serving dist or a single static server, not multiple processes that embed iframes.
- Stop any secondary preview/iframe that mounts the app a second time.

9) Temporary detection to prove the fix (remove after)
- In App.tsx:
  if ((window as any).__APP_MOUNTED__) console.error('APP_MOUNTED_TWICE');
  (window as any).__APP_MOUNTED__ = true;
- In NotFound.tsx:
  console.warn('NOTFOUND_RENDER', window.location.pathname);
- After applying fixes, reload:
  - Expect no APP_MOUNTED_TWICE logs anywhere.
  - NOTFOUND_RENDER should appear only on truly invalid URLs.

10) Cache/SW reset once
- Bump SW version.
- DevTools → Application → Unregister Service Worker + Clear site data → Reload.

Acceptance criteria
- Every page (home, gallery, forum, amenities and all tabs, triathlon leaderboard, admin and all admin subpages) renders exactly once.
- No APP_MOUNTED_TWICE logs.
- 404 page appears only for invalid URLs; never appended under valid pages.
- Network shows no unexpected 404s during normal navigation.

Please implement and reply with:
- Files changed (index.html, index.tsx/main.tsx, App.tsx route/providers, any removed nested Routers/Routes).
- Confirmation screenshots of console with no APP_MOUNTED_TWICE and correct single render.
