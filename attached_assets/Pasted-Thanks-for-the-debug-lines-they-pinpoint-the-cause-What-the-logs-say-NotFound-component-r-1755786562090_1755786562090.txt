Thanks for the debug lines — they pinpoint the cause.

What the logs say
- ❌ NotFound component rendering at: / — your client router is matching “/” to the NotFound route.
- Network has no 404s, so this is not a server/static-file issue; it’s a client-side route config problem.
- SW logs are fine; it’s bypassing cache for API routes (expected).

Subject: Fix client router matching — NotFound renders at “/” even when authenticated

Tasks
1) Route order and path specificity
- Ensure the NotFound route is last.
- Use exact matching for “/”.
  - React Router v6 example:
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      …other concrete routes…
      <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
    </Routes>
  - If using v5:
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
      …other routes…
      <Route component={NotFound} />
    </Switch>

2) Guard logic around auth/layout
- If routes are wrapped in a ProtectedRoute, confirm the guard returns children when isAuthenticated=true and isLoading=false. Do not fall through to NotFound.
- Add one-time logs inside the guard:
  console.debug('Guard', { isAuthenticated, isLoading, path: location.pathname });

3) Basename and leading slashes
- If the app uses a basename (e.g., <BrowserRouter basename="/app">), ensure all links and route paths include/omit the prefix consistently. Otherwise “/” will not match the intended route and fall to “*”.
- Print router base at startup.

4) Remove accidental catch-all above real routes
- Search for any wildcard like <Route path="*" …> or regex-like patterns that appear before your main routes.

5) Link usage
- Replace <a href="/"> for internal navigation with <Link to="/"> or navigate('/') so the router resolves correctly.
- Verify no programmatic navigate('*') or navigate('/404') runs on mount.

6) Service worker overlay (just in case)
- Ensure the NotFound UI isn’t being injected by the SW. It shouldn’t be; but bump SW version and hard reload once after fixing routes.

Acceptance criteria
- At startup, console shows:
  🔍 Router Debug … isAuthenticated: true … currentPath: "/"
  Home component renders (no NotFound render at “/”).
- Navigating to a non-existent route (e.g., /xyz) renders NotFound; “/” and known paths render normally.
- No 404 banner at the bottom of pages.

If you share the router snippet (App.tsx routes + any ProtectedRoute wrapper), I can mark the exact lines to change.
