You are helping with a Progressive Web App (PWA) project named **UniLoop**, which has recently undergone updates involving service workers, push notifications (using VAPID, not Firebase), and roll number-based features.

However, after the recent changes, the app is not rendering or showing up in the Replit Preview window or even when opened in a new tab. The screen is completely blank.

Your task is to do the following **without breaking or disturbing any existing functional workflows** (like batch/section-based list selection, or current database hooks):

### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Fix Preview Issue**
   - Diagnose why the app is not visible in Replit Preview.
   - Ensure the server is properly binding to `process.env.PORT`.
   - Confirm that the frontend entry point (`index.html`, `main.js`, `App.js`, or `vite.config.js`) is correctly configured.
   - Ensure that the service worker (if present) is properly registered and not crashing or blocking the app render.
   - Provide logs for any caught errors.

2. **Maintain All Existing Functionalities**
   - Keep all batch, section, and email-based user lookup features intact.
   - Ensure roll number integration (as secondary field) is present in both backend and frontend, including display in student directory UI.
   - Roll number should be mandatory on upload but should not override primary key (email).

3. **Optimize for PWA and Mobile**
   - Ensure that the app interface remains responsive and user-friendly on mobile (e.g. use taps, clicks instead of hover).
   - Ensure proper service worker, manifest, and install prompt support for both Android and iOS.

4. **Push Notification Integration**
   - Continue integrating push notifications for Events and Announcements using **VAPID-based Web Push**, not Firebase.
   - Build a flow that allows notifications to be triggered for selected users or batches (as already implemented), but also supports hybrid list upload via Name+Roll Number for targeted messages.

**Do not remove or change any working workflows. Fix only what is broken and complete only the pending parts.**

Let me know once the preview issue is fixed and app is fully visible again.
